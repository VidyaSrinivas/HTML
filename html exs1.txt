<p>Skylight University is a small township in itself. Rich in natural flora and fauna to begin with,
 the campus' green cover has been maintained and even increased over the years. <br>An island of green in the otherwise concrete jungle that is Mumbai, 
 the campus at Powai nestles among hills and is flanked by the Powai and Vihar lakes. </br> It is special both in terms of its physical beauty and 
 location — a place where you can be away from the busy world, yet still be a part of it.<br> Education and research are the twin pillars of this institute and 
 the ambience is one in which new ideas and creativity can flourish. .</br></p>
